This exercise will help you put some of the ideas you learned during this course section into practice.
You should create a simple Git repository containing:
A file called "README.txt" which presents the project;
At least 2 other files of your choice (they can contain code scripts, text about a personal project, etc…);
At least 4 separate commits which show the adding and modification of different files.
Pay attention to your commit messages and try to be very clear. For example, avoid messages like “commit 1”, “commit 2” etc. which don’t really explain what you changed, added, or deleted.
